# Hello Dear Viewers
Welcome my gitHub, feel free to take a look at my public projects.
## Interesting repos ⚡:
1. PyBoids - I try to coax some virtual birds, or boids, to flock. Learning and hilarity ensue
2. Ascii-Invaders - I got bored and wrote space invaders in python, it's rather clunky, but playable
3. C-Projects - A collection of interesting C Programs I developed in college; some RAM allocation simulations, the Dining Philosophers problem, and a sim of the Tragedy of the Commons
4. Java Projects - Evidence I am aware of Java ;)
## Current projects 🛠️:
* SAAL - I have some pet algae, I'm gathering some data on them and displaying it on a web page, good times
* meaj-creeps - I'm getting started in screeps, updates to this repo will be private by default, access can be granted on request
## Topics of interest 🌱:
* Programatically generated Non Fungible Tokens
* Image classification and generation
